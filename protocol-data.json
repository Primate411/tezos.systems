At that point, issuance would be capped at just 1% annually.\n\nTez Capital argued this was premature — Adaptive Issuance had only been live for 4 months. They warned that Quebec would cause rewards to \"drop by as much as one-third\" and that people were being attracted to stake with high APY promises without being told about the upcoming cuts."
